We rush through the door and there's so much to say,

But Mom's on the bed and she looks kind of gray.
           D                G
Shhhhh…This is when we're quiet.

I'm in the library, looking at books,
If I make a noise then I get funny looks.
Shhhhh…This is when we're quiet.

Today's our meeting; my friends have all come,
We've sung and we've chatted; now story's begun.
Shhhhh…This is when we're quiet.

You can train a dog to shake hands for fun

You can train a dog to shake hands for fun;
         D                           G C G
But the paw is for walking when the trick is done.

A paw is designed to run and stand.

A dog has a welcome bark, likes to race around the park,
              D          G           C
But let me know, if it steps on your toe;
            G               D G
Will it be sorry? I don't think so.

A cat has silky fur, and a deep and friendly purr,
But let me know, if it steps on your toe,
Will it be sorry? I don't think so.

It's easy now to see, they're not like you and me.
I let you know if I step on your toe;
And I'll be sorry! And I'll say so.

May be big or may be small

DELIMITERE 34
 C              F        C
May be big or may be small,

May be big or may be small
Size doesn't matter much at all

Family is really great.

To a happy family;

That's what makes a family.

The truth you try so hard to hide
     G                    C
By telling just a little lie

Your folks and friends will realize
That they cannot trust you.
