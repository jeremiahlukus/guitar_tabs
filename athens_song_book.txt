        On Your head and on Your feet,
        On You, most precious One,
        Because You love me.

4   Let my love from my being wash Your feet
    And my glory without wipe them too.
    Let me kiss them where the nails would pierce.
    All my love, Lord, and glory I'll waste on You.

        I love You!
        Jesus, I love You!
        All my glory and love I pour

                G       D           Em         A    D     A

     Day by day and year by year go by.
           G            D          Em          G          D

         Bm             F#m             Em              Bm
         Deep inside me, my conscience tells me:
           G            A               Bm A
         I need another destiny.



2    I convinced my friends
     That everything's alright,
     That my life and future
     And everything's so bright.
     But a sense inside me,
     My friends, I can't deny,
     Warning deep inside me
     That I was living a lie.



3    The world and its glitter
     Left me anxious, dark, and bitter,
     Always yearning, my friends,
     Is there something better?
     And religion, my friends,
     Is just a Sunday game —
     Dead teachings and doctrines
     Will leave you just the same.
4   Oh God, where are You?
    I need You desperately!
    Oh God, who are You?
    Why don't You answer me?
    The heavens declare You
    And the earth shows Your beauty.
    But I'm a man.
    Oh God, I'm so empty!



       Lord, have mercy! I'm crying for You!
       Please hear! Are you really true?
       I'm dark and lonely. You're far, far from me.
       Oh Lord, I need You desperately!



5   One day a friend told me
    That Jesus is the Lord.
    To my great surprise,
    It's written in the Word.
    They asked me to believe You.
    Your name I once blasphemed.
    Dear Lord, You saved me
    Just by calling on Your name.



       Oh, Lord Jesus, dear Son, so glorious,
       I'm cleansed and You entered into me.
       Oh, Lord Jesus, Your name most precious!
       Your Person, dear Lord, I now possess.

     You're swept by the world of deceptive vanity,
     A tide looking good, but it's void of reality.


         Just call "Oh Lord Jesus": the truth you're confessing
         That God raised this Jesus from among the dead.
         Your heart this believing, just call to receive Him.
         He's Jesus the Savior, your great salvation.

    Trapped in a wheel of human anxiety.
    You are caught, you're in the web already.
    You're spun to this song: you're just the spider's prey.


       Jesus crushed the devil and overcame evil.
       That kingdom He leveled and destroyed the devil.
       He will free you from sin,
               from death, world and Satan.
       Just call "Oh Lord Jesus" and He will enter in.


5   Life is a song as a time hour glass,
    Sand by sand, my friend it cannot last.
    You're born, you live, and eventually you die.
    Friend, you can't change it, no need to even try.


       There is a new song, a wonderful Person!
       He's Jesus the Lord, He's God's beloved Son!
       This wonderful Person is now your solution!

2    In darkness once I groped,

     My heart enlightened.

     You came to me as light
     And shattered all my night.
     Your glory, what a sight!
     You made me, Lord, so bright.
3   To You my heart was drawn,
    It wasn't on my own.
    Your beauty made me turn
    And caused my heart to burn.

    You touched my hardened heart
    And softened every part.
    I saw Your shining face.
    Now nothing can erase.



4   Lord, I could not believe,
    But, Lord, You still appeared.
    Your life in me conceived,
    Dear Lord, I now believe.

    You called not being as being
    In me conceiving.
    Your life transfusing,
    I'm now reacting.



       O God of glory,
       You're now my story.
       Dear One, I can't refuse!
       By You, I've been transfused.



5   Like father Abraham,
    To You, dear Lord, he ran.
    With glory we’re infused,
    Dear Lord, we can't refuse.

    You came to fallen man
    As, Lord, the Great I Am
    In us dispensing
    The blessing to mankind.

4    You died, Lord, on Calvary.
     Your blood is flowing now for me.
     Your blood, Lord, is precious.
     O, what a price You paid for us!

    Drove me seeking satisfaction.

    ’Til I drank You as my living Spring.

     Life is uncreated.

     And this is the life that’s indestructible

     Now this life is spreading.
     Lord, don’t stop - - just keep invading.
     For this, Lord, we must be daily revived.

4    Life needs our maintaining,
     Otherwise we’re suffocating.
     Calling on His name we breathe Him in.
     Everywhere we breathe Him,
     Makes us fresh and makes us living.
     O, this life is full of hope and meaning.

5    In our daily living
     It’s this life that we are sensing.
     Are we in the flesh or in the Lord?
     If you’re dead and empty
     And the troubles you have plenty,
     Saints, get out of there and flee back to the Lord!

6    Then you’ll sense life flowing.
     It’s this life that’s overcoming
     Satan, flesh, and the world, and sin.
     What a life we’re having. Lord, Your virtues manifesting,
     Thus, we’re branches bearing fruit in John 15.

     His saints, the Bride, portrayed.

2    Through shadows, types and figures,
     God's deepest thought is known;
     As typified by Adam,
     The Husband, Christ, is shown.
     A rib brought forth from Adam
     Reveals the source of life
     By which God built a woman:
     Eve, as the church, His wife.

3    To be His people's Husband,
     To take them as His wife:
     This is what God desires
     To live in marriage life.
     Their sacrifice and worship
     Alone could not content;
     But with them to be married
     Was God's foremost intent.

4    This romance is the finest
     As seen in Song of Songs;
     For her Beloved's kisses
     His seeking lover longs.
     Love's work in her produces
     No person of her own,
     But she becomes the City,
     Her Person, Christ alone.
5   Christ is our coming Bridegroom;
    We are the Church, His Bride,
    Redeemed, regenerated,
    The issue of His side,
    In source, in life, in nature
    And person fully one,
    His counterpart forever,
    The New Jerusalem.

     They left him lying there half dead.

1    Now from my heart comes
    A5
     A happy song;
    A6
     It’s just for You, Lord,
    A7
     There’s only One:
     D   E         A    A7
     Jesus, I love You.


         D
         How I long to sing
                   E
         With my spirit and heart to You.
         C#m
         Jesus, You’re so rich;
                       F#
         In who You are and what You do.
         Bm                         E
         Ev’ry time I turn and open up,

         I drink of You.
                  A             E
         ‘Cause I love You.


2    I’ve seen how they
     Pierced Your side,
     You gave Your all
     To win your bride.
     J-E-S-U-S, I love You.

3    Without Your love, Lord,
     I’m so empty,
     Life has no meaning;
     Just vanity,
     Jesus, Reality.

4    Jesus in me.
     What a wonder;
     Bubbling over,
     Living water.
     Jesus, What a joy!

The spirit of the prophet

Is subject to the prophet;
     D
The word declares it so.

I don’t have to wait for an inspiration,
     G
My spirit is ready to go.

I don’t have to live according to my feelings,
     C               Am
Or wait for a better day.

3    All of God’s power for His creation,
     And all His might in incarnation,
     Strength to be crucified
     Which by the power of God was supplied.

4    And His great power in resurrection,
     He wrought in Christ, even ascension!
     All things He has subdued
     Under His feet, by power overruled.

         (Chorus)
5   Now in the church, in God’s transmission,
    All that He is, to His destination,
    Here constantly receive.
    He is dispensed to us who believe.

6   The Triune God is now transmitting
    Himself, this power, us energizing,
    In us He is installed;
    This dynamo within, the Triune God!

     My heart be given to love You
     To treasure and to serve You

1    Some, these days, would tell us
               G
     That our Jesus is not food,
     C              G
     That we only need to know
         A7                     D
     About Him and do good,
     G                      C
     But we’re glad to tell you, brothers,
     G
     It’s just not that way —
     C             G
     Jesus is the bread of life;
          A7       D         G
     We eat Him every day.

                        G7
          We love the church life:
          C                         G            C
          Eating, drinking, breathing Jesus.
          G             Em                  A7                D

          G             Em                  A7       D7       G
          We love the church life: feasting with the Lord.

2    When He fills our inward parts,
     We’re never quite the same;
     So much richness we can taste
     By calling on His name.
     “Services” but once a week
     For us will never do.
     Every day we need the fellowship
     To take us through.

3    If these latter days and
     Situations of the world
     Make you feel that round a
     Vicious circle you are swirled,
     Then please listen closely
     To the things we have to say;
     It may be that you will find
     With us a better way.

         He came as food, so now we take Him in.

              G                                  E7
         To come and meet with us.
                    Am7        D7            G
         Just enjoy the Lord Jesus!


2   If you are thirsty, He’s heard your cry.
    He is a fountain that will not run dry.
    He’s quenching our longings; we’re satisfied.
    Just eating and drinking the risen Lord —
    Yes, that is why He died!


         So He could become the Spirit; get into us.
         Fill all our being — Oh, how glorious!
         It’s really so simple, just take and eat,
         That’s all you have to do!
         Come enjoy the Lord Jesus!

1    There are three kinds of life in our existence today:
              G          D              E7               A7
     There is bios, the physical, and soul-life, psuche;
              D                                           G
     Now the third life is God’s life and its called zoe;
                         D                          A7        D
     And we all have to choose what life we’ll live by today.


         Oh, it’s God in Christ Jesus, through the Spirit today,
                                               E7                 A7
         Who is flowing within us, flowing through us this way.
                   D                                          G
         We don’t care for the bios; we don’t want psuche;
                               D          A7         D
         All we want is God’s zoe life to fill us today.


2    We don’t care for the bios, we don’t care for the soul.
     We don’t care for the cares of life,
        world’s pleasure and show.
     We don’t care for the pride of life, the flesh and sin —
     We say, “No!” to the soul-life; we’ll take God’s life within.


3    Do you know what God’s life is? Well, just listen to this:
     It is God in Christ Jesus through the Spirit — no less!
     He is flowing within us; He is flowing through —
     Hallelujah! He’s moving to make everything new.


4    We have this life within us, in our spirit today;
     To our spirit we turn, O Lord, and take You this way.
     We can overcome bios and psuche too;
     Hallelujah, the Spirit of the Lord takes us through.

    Is my whole being, love outpoured;
    Lord, I belong to You.

     Sweet water running inside of me.
     Oh, how I love to live on the mountain,
     Ever since Jesus set me free!

     Race for the Son with all your might.
     Guard your heart like a gold medallion;
     Keep the kingdom full in sight.

1   There's a gospel of today
          GM9                C*                 G
    That says believe and you'll be saved, and then
                      C*                 GM9
    You can go to heaven and see the pearly gates

    And walk the golden streets.

    Words like these — fail to treat
               G G/F# Em-C       D       G
    All the vanity — that is hidden in me.

2   But the gospel is to me
    The Triune God within humanity
    As the Spirit reaching me to be in me
    The One reality.
    Love untold — Gospel Thee
    Never getting old — story told eternally.

3   Left the ninety-nine behind —
    You searched until the lost sheep You did find
    Laid me on Your shoulders there, You bore me in
    Your tender loving care.
    Rejoicing — You found me,
    Though a small lost sheep —You gave all to come find me.

4   Sweeping in my deepest parts,
    You lit a lamp and searched my inward heart,
    Sanctifying deep within You shined in me,
    Exposed me of my sin.
    Repenting — now I see
    Lord, You're sprinkling me —
    With the blood You shed for me.

5   Eagerly awaiting me
    That I the slightest turn to Thee would make.
    Though my life had been a wreck, You ran to me
    And fell upon my neck.
    Kissing me, affectionately,
    Killed the calf for me — "Let us eat and be merry."

        Lord, I let my entire being
        Be occupied by Thee.
        As I enter in Your heart,

              Occupied and lost in You,
              My Lord, You're my everything.
              Fellowship so intimate;
              In spirit, Lord, I enjoy Thee.
3   Lord, there's none in heav'n nor on earth
    That I desire but Thee.
    Though my heart and flesh faileth, Lord,
    Thou ever my portion will be.
    All is vanity, all is dung —
    I count all other things loss.
    Everything else drains my love,
    But You have captured my heart.


       Lord, I've seen Thy preciousness,
       Thy worth, Thy reality.

       My heart is only for Thee.

     My destiny is to die; can You help me survive?
     Lord, I know that You can.
     All others, Lord, run away when they come see my face,
     Helpless hopeless I am.


         Stretching out Your hand unto me,
         How my heart was warmed when You touched me
         With compassion; moved with love I never knew.

    Met my robbers who stripped me and left me half dead.
    The priests and Levites 'cause they also traveled my way,
    Couldn't help me a bit.
    But, Lord, You came to the earth,
    Despised and slandered
    A Samaritan low,
    With divinity there and humanity's care,
    Tender and merciful.


       Bound my wounds and poured in oil and wine,
       Gave Your Spirit to me and life divine,
       To the church brought me where care I could receive,

     Then the Lord brought some saints my own way
     I alone could not Thee apprehend

    Nothing matches me but You.
    Only Your life will do.

    For you to grow in me each day.
    Through this love, show me the world's passing away.

    I'm here for You and this You know.
    Day by day, Your life within me has to grow.
    Though this world is so corrupt,
    I can and do love You.

    That the world may take a drink of You and see
    That You are the only way,

2   Too wondrous are these moments
    When with Thee, Lord, I stay
    Apart from all distraction,
    Thou Savior of my day.
    When Thou alone canst enter
    And settle in each part
    Of this poor chosen vessel
    To make Thy home my heart.

3   Each time I so enjoy Thee,
    I learn a lesson new.
    While gazing on Thy glory
    Sweet words I hear from You,
    Words that will lead me daily
    To dwell with Thee in light,
    Words that will e’en transform me
    To bear Thine image bright.

4   With guilt of sin abandoned
    And death of night subdued,
    With dew of morning mercy
    And grace of life endued,
    With whispers of Thy love sweet
    And glimpse of glory bright —
    With Thy dear self, Lord Jesus,
    I set my day aright.

    Was sent forth to proclaim
    The year of the jubilee.
    Twelve disciples, they were
    All perfected so that

    And glory closed the way for us
    C   G       G7       C
    To eat the tree of life.


2   Our body — one of sin and death,
    Our spirit — comatose, bereft
    Of function and of life.
    Sin roamed and reigned and ruled while we
    As slaves under its tyranny
    Despaired — dead while alive.


3   Yet who can thwart the heart of God?
    Whose deep desire and single thought
    Was to be one with man?
    The Vine, the branches, many sons,
    Remained His foremost aim! Hope dawns
    As He unfolds His plan.


4   Determined counsel sent the Son,
    Redeemer, God and man in one
    To suffer, die for man.
    He satisfied every demand,
    Opened the way to life again.
    “’Tis finished,” cries the Lamb!


5   Now all our sins have been forgiv’n,
    We’re justified! The veil is riv’n!
    We’re washed and purified.
    And reconciled to Him at last,
    E’en sanctified — no more outcast
    We’re sep’rate unto Him!
6   Oh Hallelujah, life can flow,
    With boldness forward we can go
    And see the face of God!
    A new and living way is paved,
    We eat the tree, no more enslaved,
    And man is joined to God!

2   Yet this life, though it frees, is not meant for mere victory.
    God is full of intent and never could flow aimlessly.

    A consummate issue encompassing me,
    Life moves and life grows, life shapes as it flows,
    Now I share in this life's destiny,

        Come, drink! And riverside
        Grows the tree, our enjoyment for eternity!
3   So I've no cause to frown, as one who received this zoe.
    I know life runs its course, and triumphs inevitably.
    I'm required just to stay in the flow.
    If I do the drinking then God gives the growth!
    So there's joy in my heart, and a spring in my step,
    And a smile on my face as I sing,
    Oh I've got rivers of life
    Flowing out of my innermost being!

2   Ephesus, lost in noble endeavors,
    Present in deed, but absent in heart,
    Traded her flame for cold occupation,
    Outwardly true, but within apart.


3   Is there a work that dares Him to rival?
    Is there a field that with Him competes?
    Sever its hold and let it lie fallow —
    While I have Him, my joy is complete.


4   Hours once fed my many engagements;
    Now they mark time to stay in His arms.
    Gladly this ox who fed upon labor
    Saw past the yoke and drank in His charms!

    His name is called Jesus, and He came to seek us



3   Though I've been a sinner, I now have been redeemed
    By Christ who died for me, who was raised in glory.
    I am joined to Him now, together we're living;
    I love to enjoy Him, for I've been forgiven.



4   His love is so tender, to Him I'll surrender;
    His name is so precious, I gladly call, "Jesus!"
    His Person's so charming, my heart ever winning;
    I'll hold back no longer, I'll love Him forever.

2   Your whisper, Lord, so softly sounding,
    Deep within my heart does burn.
    Let Your stillness now subdue me,
    That Your feeling I discern.


3   All idle thoughts and impure feelings,
    Lord, remove from my dead heart.
    Wash me in the crystal water
    And more life to me impart.


4   All hidden things that block my vision,
    Rocks of self-ambition, pride;
    Now expose and burn away, Lord,
    By Your look intensified.


5   Increase the weight of glory in me;
    Let Your Spirit now transform,
    That all things would not be wasted
    But would work to save me more.


6   Lord Jesus, oh, how much I need You!
    Thank You, Lord, that You are here,
    Ever present as the Body.
    I would always seek You there.

3   Born of the Spirit in our spirit,
    Christ is our life and nature, divine;
    All of the elements of the Spirit
    Now in our living Christ will entwine.


4   The all-inclusive, glorified Jesus
    By transformation spreads in our hearts;
    God’s divine attributes in man’s virtues

          Dear Lord, my inmost heart You’ve captured & won.


2 Dead I was in sin, Lord, so lost without You;
  Helpless, wounded, weary, rebellious, too;
  But Lord, You came! You would not let me go;
  The blood and water flowed from Your side,
  Constraining me to tell You…


3 Thank You Lord, You opened my blind eyes to see
  I was lame, but now I can walk; You healed me!
  My leprosy, Lord, You cleansed all away;
  My ears were opened to hear Your voice,
  And now I follow You ‘cause…


4 Sometimes Lord, I’m drawn off by my selfish cares;
  And the world it draws me with glitter and glare.
  O Lord, You’ve trapped me. Don’t let me go.
  Kiss me and woo me, and win my heart,
  So, I will always tell You…
5 Keep my heart so soft, Lord, so open to You;
  It would be the good ground to bear fruit for You;
  Capture my friends, Lord, and build us, I pray;
  Your Bride, We’d match You in every way,
  And, corporately we tell You:

       Jesus, come quickly,
       We’re waiting for You;
       We’re the virgins to You,
       So single and true;
       Forever and ever Your counterpart true.

2   Lord, before time had begun
    We were marked and called out by You.
    We had no choice, we were trapped by You, Lord.
    We had no place we could run.



3   Some of my friends are so free.
    Who could I blame, Lord, but Thee?
    I cannot do all the things that they do,

    To be thoroughly filled with the Lord.



2 Now although I'm still kind of small,
  And the future is in front of me.
  In my heart I've heard the Lord's call,
  Just to follow Him absolutely.
  Though the path may be holding
  Much joy or much pain,
  What matters is that more of Him I would gain,
  Regardless what happens,
  I never would change.
  'Cause I'm made to be filled with the Lord.
  Yes, I'm made to be filled with the Lord.

    That His only Son He gave,
    That His only Son He gave.


4   Loving Father, now before Thee

3   Dear Name! the Rock on which we build;
    Our shield and hiding-place;
    Our never-failing treasury, filled
    With boundless stores of grace.


4   Jesus, our Savior, Shepherd, Friend,
    Our Prophet, Priest, and King;
    Our Lord, our Life, our Way, our End,
    Accept the praise we bring.


5   Weak is the effort of our heart,
    And cold our warmest thought;
    But when we see Thee as Thou art,
    We’ll praise Thee as we ought.


6   Till then we would Thy love proclaim
    With every fleeting breath;
    And triumph in that blessed Name
    Which quells the pow’r of death.

    Calling up our hearts to Thee!


2   Loved with love which knows no measure,
    Save the Father’s love to Thee,
    Blessed Lord, our hearts would treasure
    All the Father’s thoughts of Thee.


3   All His joy, His rest, His pleasure —
    All His deep delight in Thee —
    Lord, Thy heart alone can measure
    What Thy Father found in Thee.


4   How He set His love upon Thee —
    Called Thee His beloved Son;
    Yet for us He did not spare Thee,
    By Thy death our life was won.


5   O the joy, the wondrous singing,
    When we see Thee as Thou art!
    Thy blest name, Lord Jesus, bringing
    Sweetest music to God’s heart.

1   O Christ, He is the fountain,
            G                D        A
    The deep, sweet well of life:
        D           G                D G
    Its living streams I’ve tasted
                D            A             D - D7
    Which save from grief and strife.

    And to an ocean fullness,
        G           Gm       D
    His mercy doth expand;

    His grace is all-sufficient
        D           A7           D
    As by His wisdom planned.


2   O I am my Beloved’s,
    And my Beloved’s mine;
    He brings a poor vile sinner
    Into His house of wine!
    I stand upon His merit;
    I know no other stand.
    I’m hidden in His presence
    And held by His own hand.


3   The Bride eyes not her garment,
    But her dear Bridegroom’s face;
    I will not gaze at glory,
    But on my King of grace:
    Not at the crown He giveth,
    But on His pierced hand;
    The Lamb is all the glory,
    And my eternal stand!

    Within my very soul.

3   For Thou to me art all in all;
    My honor and my wealth;
    My heart’s desire, my body’s strength,
    My soul’s eternal health.

4   Burn, burn, O love, within my heart,
    Burn fiercely night and day,
    Till all the dross of earthly loves
    Is burned, and burned away.

5   O light in darkness, joy in grief,
    O heaven’s life on earth;
    Jesus, my love, my treasure, who
    Can tell what Thou art worth?

6   What limit is there to this love?
    Thy flight, where wilt Thou stay?
    On, on! Our Lord is sweeter far
    Today than yesterday.

    All elements human, divine,
    The living of man in Him
    And glory of God combine.


4   The suff’ring of human life,
    Effectiveness of His death,
    His rising and reigning too
    Are all in the Spirit’s breath.


5   With all these components true
    His Spirit in us doth move,
    And by His anointing full
    The riches of Christ we prove.


6   This Spirit of Jesus doth
    Encompass both great and small;
    Inclusively He doth work

    Empty me, fill me, and use me,

    Through me the rivers can flow;
    Thus and thus only will others

    Jesus sought me when a stranger,
                             G       D
    Wand’ring from the face of God;
                                 A
    He, to save my soul from danger,
         G           A           D
    Interposed His precious blood.


2   O to grace how great a debtor
    Daily I’m constrained to be!
    Let that grace, Lord, like a fetter,
    Bind my wand’ring heart to Thee.
    Teach me, Lord, some rapturous measure,
    Meet for me Thy grace to prove,
    While I sing the countless treasure
    Of my God’s unchanging love.


3   Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it;
    Prone to leave the God I love:
    Take my heart, oh, take and seal it
    With Thy Spirit from above.
    Rescued thus from sin and danger,
    Purchased by the Savior’s blood,
    May I walk on earth a stranger,
    As a son and heir of God.

1   Many weary years I vainly sought a spring,
    D                               G – G7
    One that never would run dry;
    C                                G             Em
    Unavailing all that earth to me could bring,
    A7                          D – D7
    Nothing seemed to satisfy.


         G                                    C
         Drinking at the Fountain that never runs dry,
         G                 Em            A7         D
         Drinking at the Fountain of life am I;
         G                 G7
         Finding joy and pleasure
         C
         In abounding measure,
                G               D                 G–C–G
         I am drinking at the Fountain of life.


2   Through the desert land of sin I roam no more,
    For I find a living Spring,
    And my cup of gladness now is running o’er,
    Jesus is my Lord and King.


3   Here     is sweet contentment as the days go by,
    Here     is holy peace and rest;
    Here     is consolation as the moments fly,
    Here     my heart is always blest.


4   Here I find a never ending, sure supply,
    While the endless ages roll;
    To this healing Fountain I would ever fly,
    There to bathe my weary soul.

    "Come unto Me, and rest;

    Lay down, thou weary one, lay down

    Weary, and worn, and sad;
                   Dm                      G
    I found in Him a resting-place,
           Dm          A7             Dm
    And He has made me glad.



2   I heard the voice of Jesus say,
    "Behold, I freely give
    The living water: thirsty one,
    Stoop down, and drink, and live."
    I came to Jesus, and I drank
    Of that life-giving stream;
    My thirst was quenched, my soul revived,
    And now I live in Him.



3   I heard the voice of Jesus say,
    "I am this dark world's Light;
    Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise,
    And all thy day be bright."
    I looked to Jesus, and I found
    In Him my Star, my Sun;
    And in that Light of life I'll walk
    Till trav'lling days are done.

    Every power as Thou shalt choose.
    Every power as Thou shalt choose.

5   Take my will, and make it Thine;
    It shall be no longer mine.
    Take my heart; it is Thine own;
    It shall be Thy royal throne.
    It shall be Thy royal throne.

6   Take my love; my Lord, I pour
    At Thy feet its treasure-store.
    Take myself, and I will be
    Ever, only, all for Thee.
    Ever, only, all for Thee.

    D                       A             G             D
1   I’ve turned my back upon the world
           G        A        D
    With all its idle pleasures,
                                         A
    And set my heart on better things,
        E7                       A
    On higher, holier treasures;
       D                A            G             D
    No more it’s glitter and its glare,
           A7                    D
    And vanity shall blind me;
                             D7          G         Gm
    I’ve crossed the separating line,
           D                             A7       D
    And left the world behind me.

        And left the world behind me.


2   I’ve left the old sad life of sin,
    Its follies all forsaken;
    My standing place is now in Christ,
    His holy vows I’ve taken;
    Beneath the standard of the cross
    The world henceforth shall find me;
    I’ve passed in Christ from death to life,
    And left the world behind me.


        Far, far behind me! Far, far behind me!
        I’ve passed in Christ from death to life,
        And left the world behind me.
3   My soul shall ne’er return again
    Back to its former station,
    For here alone is perfect peace,
    And rest from condemnation;
    I’ve made exchange of masters now,
    The vows of glory bind me,
    And once for all I’ve left the world,
    Yes, left the world behind me.


       Far, far behind me! Far, far behind me!
       And once for all I’ve left the world,
       Yes, left the world behind me.


4   My choice is made forevermore,
    I want no other Savior;
    I ask no purer happiness
    Than His sweet love and favor;
    My heart is fixed on Jesus Christ,
    No more the world shall blind me;
    I’ve crossed the Red Sea of His death,
    And left the world behind me.


       Far, far behind me! Far, far behind me!
       I’ve crossed the Red Sea of His death,
       And left the world behind me.

2   Idols once they won thee, charmed thee,

3   What has stripped the seeming beauty
    From the idols of the earth?
    Not a sense of right or duty,
    But the sight of peerless worth.

4   Not the crushing of those idols,
    With its bitter void and smart;
    But the beaming of His beauty,
    The unveiling of His heart.

5   Who extinguishes their taper
    Till they hail the rising sun?
    Who discards the garb of winter
    Till the summer has begun?

6   ’Tis that look that melted Peter,
    ’Tis that face that Stephen saw,
    ’Tis that heart that wept with Mary,
    Can alone from idols draw:

7   Draw and win and fill completely,
    Till the cup o’erflow the brim;
    What have we to do with idols
    Who have companied with Him?

2   When such as we the King can choose,

    In Calv’ry’s hosts enrolled.



3   Arise! the holy bargain strike 
    The fragment for the whole 
    All men and all events alike
    Must serve the ransomed soul.
    All things are yours when you are His,
    And He and you are one;
    A boundless life in Him there is,
    Whence doubt and fear are gone.

    Labor with Thee hour by hour.

3   One with Thee, Thou Son forsaken,
    Judgment and the curse we’ve passed;
    We to sin are dead forever,
    Hell beneath our feet is cast.

    Death can never us oppress;
    Live we in Thy new creation,
    Bearing fruits of righteousness.

    Seated with Thee on the throne,
    Thine authority we share and
    Rule with Thee, Thy rank our own.

    Of Godhead and of man and all things else;

2   All types and figures of the ancient time,
    All things we ever need, both great and small,
    Only are shadows of the Christ of God,
    Showing that He must be our all in all.


3   All things are vanity of vanities,
    Christ, the reality all things to fill;
    Though everything we may enjoy and own,
    If we’re devoid of Christ we’re empty still.


4   Christ is our real God, our real Lord,
    Christ is our real life, our real light;
    Christ is our real food, our real drink,
    Our real clothing, and our real might.


5   Christ also is the one reality
    Of all our doctrine and theology;
    And all our scriptural knowledge without Him
    Is just in letter and is vanity.


6   Christ, the reality of time and space,
    Christ, the reality of every stage;
    Christ is the one reality of all
    Through all eternity from age to age.

2   Was there e'er story so moving,
    Story of love and pain;
    Was there e'er Bridegroom so loving,
    Seeking our hearts to gain.


3   I am so glad I received Him,
    Jesus my heart's dear King;
    I who so often have grieved Him,
    All to His feet would bring


4   How can I ever be lonely,
    How can I ever fall;
    What can I want, if only
    Christ is my all in all?


5   Now in His bosom confiding,
    This my glad song shall be;
    I am in Christ abiding,
    And Christ abides in me.

    Christ now is being formed in me.
    His very nature and life divine
    In my whole being inwrought shall be.
    All that I am came to an end,
    And all of Christ is all to me.


3   Oh, what a thought! Oh, what a boast!
    Christ shall in me be magnified.
    In nothing shall I be ashamed,
    For He in all shall be applied.
    In woe or blessing, death or life,
    Through me shall Christ be testified.


4   Oh, what a prize! Oh, what a gain!
    Christ is the goal toward which I press.
    Nothing I treasure, nor aught desire,
    But Christ of all-inclusiveness.
    My hope, my glory, and my crown
    Is Christ, the One of peerlessness.

2   The fulness of God dwells in Thee;
    Thou dost manifest God’s glory;
    In flesh Thou hast redemption wrought;
    As Spirit, oneness with me sought.



3   All things of the Father are Thine;
    All Thou art in Spirit is mine;
    The Spirit makes Thee real to me,
    That Thou experienced might be.



4   The Spirit of life causes Thee
    By Thy Word to transfer to me.
    Thy Spirit touched, Thy word received,
    Thy life in me is thus conceived.
5   In spirit while gazing on Thee,
    As a glass reflecting Thy glory,
    Like to Thyself transformed I’ll be,
    That Thou might be expressed thru me.



6   In no other way could we be
    Sanctified and share Thy vict’ry;
    Thus only spiritual we’ll be
    And touch the life of glory.



7   Thy Spirit will me saturate,
    Every part will God permeate,
    Deliv’ring me from the old man,
    With all saints building for His plan.

        That Christ liveth in me.


2   As rays of light from yonder sun,
    The flow’rs of earth set free,
    So life and light and love come forth
    From Christ living in me.


3   As lives the flow’r within the seed,
    As in the cone the tree,
    So, praise the Christ of truth and grace,
    His Spirit dwelleth in me.


4   With longing all my heart is filled,
    That like Him I may be,
    As on the wondrous thought I dwell
    That Christ liveth in me.

1   A flowing river and a tree,
    A7             D                      A
    Eden’s outstanding features are,
              E7
    Man to supply with food and drink
                       B7       E    E7
    That he may live fore’er.

                            E         A
         Filled with His life I’ll be.


2   The tree the glorious Christ does show
    As living food to man supplied,
    That he God’s riches may enjoy,
    Thus to be satisfied.


3   The river does the Spirit show,
    Coming man’s spirit to supply,
    That with God’s riches he be filled,
    Holy to be thereby.


4   The Christ of glory is my life,
    He as the Spirit lives in mine,
    That I with God be fully blent
    And in His image shine.


5   I would exalt this glorious Christ,
    Ever the Spirit I’d obey,
    Making His glory fully known,
    Filled with His grace for aye.

        Lord Jesus, found in Thee.

2   I sighed for rest and happiness,
    I yearned for them, not Thee;
    But, while I passed my Savior by,
    His love laid hold on me.


3   I tried the broken cisterns, Lord,
    But, ah, the waters failed!
    E’en as I stooped to drink they fled,
    And mocked me as I wailed.


4   The pleasures lost I sadly mourned,
    But never wept for Thee,
    Till grace the sightless eyes received,
    Thy loveliness to see.

    Once for death I waited,

    All my steps He regulates,
    Every part He saturates.


5   Him expressing from within,
    Making Him to others seen,
    I transparent have to be

2   Touching Thee in faith, I take Thee

    All Thou art Thou giv’st to me.


3   Touching now Thine outstretched scepter,
    O most mighty King of kings;
    Of Thy fullness now receiving,
    High I mount on eagle wings.

4   Grace and virtue, strength and wisdom,
    All my need, by Thee supplied;
    Keep me touching, keep me claiming,
    Keep me ever at Thy side.

1   Simply trusting every day;
              A                    D
    Trusting through a stormy way;

    Even when my faith is small,
              G             D
    Trusting Jesus, that is all.

        Trusting as the moments fly,

        Trusting as the days go by,

        Trusting Him, whate’er befall,

2   Brightly doth His Spirit shine
    Into this poor heart of mine;
    While He leads I cannot fall,

    Praying if the path be drear;
    If in danger, for Him call,
    Trusting Jesus, that is all.


4   Trusting Him while life shall last,
    Trusting Him till earth is past,
    Till His gracious advent call,

    D                    F#m
1   I take Thy promise, Lord, in all its length,
    G                           A
    And breadth and fulness, as my daily strength;
    D                 F#m
    Into life’s future fearless I may gaze,
    G                       A                 D
    For, Savior, Thou art with me all the days.


2   Days may be coming fraught with loss and change,
    New scenes surround my life and fancies strange;
    I thank Thee that no day can ever break,
    Savior, when Thou wilt leave me or forsake.


3   There may be days of darkness and distress,
    When sin has power to tempt, and care to press,
    Yet in the darkest day I will not fear,
    For, ’mid the shadows, Thou wilt still be near.


4   Days there may be of joy and deep delight,
    When earth seems fairest, and her skies most bright,
    Then draw me closer to Thee, lest I rest
    Elsewhere, my Savior, than upon Thy breast.


5   And all the other days that make my life,
    Marked by no special joy or grief or strife,
    Days filled with quiet duties, trivial care,
    Burdens too small for other hearts to share;


6   Spend Thou these days with me, all shall be Thine,
    So shall the darkest hour with glory shine.
    Then when these earthly years have passed away,
    Let me be with Thee in the perfect day.

    My everlasting All,

    I've none but Thee in heav'n above,

    Or on this earthly ball.

             D                   F#m
    What empty things are all the skies,
         Bm               F#m
    And this inferior clod!
                 G                  D
    There's nothing here deserves my joys,
                 Em   A             D
    There's nothing like my God.



2   To Thee I owe my wealth, and friends,
    And health, and safe abode;
    Thanks to Thy name for meaner things,
    But they are not my God.

    How vain a toy is glittering wealth,
    If once compared to Thee!
    Or what's my safety, or my health,
    Or all my friends to me.



3   Were I possessor of the earth,
    And called the stars my own,
    Without Thy graces and Thyself,
    I were a wretch undone.

    Let others stretch their arms like seas,
    And grasp in all the shore;
    Grant me the visits of Thy grace,
    And I desire no more.

1   Death cannot hold the resurrection life,

    The life of God eternal manifest;
    D          D7   G           Em

    A7              D      Em         A   D
    ’Tis Christ Himself, unconqu’rable expressed.


2   Death cannot hold the resurrection life,
    Though all its force against it may combine;
    Death only gives it opportunity
    To show the boundless pow’r of life divine.


3   Death cannot hold the resurrection life,
    The more interred, the more it multiplies;
    All kinds of suff’ring only help it grow
    And fruits of life abundant realize.


4   Death cannot hold the resurrection life,
    Thru every block and barrier it breaks;
    Conqu’ring the pow’r of darkness and of hell,
    It swallows death and victory partakes.


5   Death cannot hold the resurrection life,
    All of God’s fullness it will manifest;
    God’s righteousness and holiness it yields,
    His glorious image by it is expressed.


6   Oh, may I know this resurrection life,
    In every kind of death its pow’r outpoured,
    In my experience ever realize
    This life is nought but Christ my living Lord.

2   Through death into life everlasting
    He passed, and we follow Him there;
    O’er us sin no more hath dominion
    For more than conqu’rors we are!

    Believe Him and all will be well;
    Then go to a world that is dying,

    Though all things around us be trying,
                                                      C
    Though floods of affliction like sea billows roar,

    It’s better to sing than be sighing.

        Then rejoice evermore, rejoice evermore,

        So let us rejoice evermore.


2   O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore,
    When the darts of the tempter are flying,
    For Satan still dreads, as he oft did of yore,
    Our singing much more than our sighing.


3   O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore,
    When sickness upon us is stealing,
    No cordial like gladness our strength can restore,
    For joy is the fountain of healing.

    D         G
1   A little bird I am,
          D                 A7
    Shut from the fields of air,
    D             G           D
    And in my cage I sit and sing
                              A7
    To Him who placed me there;
    G                 A7         F#m—Bm
    Well pleased a prisoner to be,
    G                 A7             D
    Because, my God, it pleaseth Thee.

2   Nought have I else to do,
    I sing the whole day long;
    And He whom most I love to please
    Doth listen to my song;
    He caught and bound my wandering wing;
    But still He bends to hear me sing.

3   Thou hast an ear to hear
    A heart to love and bless;
    And though my notes were e'er so rude,
    Thou wouldst not hear the less;
    Because Thou knowest as they fall,
    That love, sweet love, inspires them all.

4   My cage confines me round;
    Abroad I cannot fly;
    But though my wing is closely bound,
    My heart's at liberty;
    For prison walls cannot control
    The flight, the freedom of the soul.

5   O it is good to soar
    These bolts and bars above!
    To Him whose purpose I adore,
    Whose providence I love;
    And in Thy mighty will to find
    The joy, the freedom of the mind.

1   God’s intention is to have us

        Saturate us with Thy Spirit,
                        A     D
        All our being wholly fill.


2   God hath us regenerated
    In our spirit with His life;
    But He must transform us further —
    In our soul by His own life.


3   Spreading outward from our spirit
    Doth the Lord transform our soul,
    By the inward parts renewing,
    Till within His full control.


4   By the power of His Spirit
    In His pattern He transforms;
    From His glory to His glory
    To His image He conforms.


5   He transforms, all sanctifying,
    Till like Him we are matured;
    He transforms, our soul possessing,
    Till His stature is secured.

    Let my spirit motivate.

5   But, Lord, we fully realize
    These are not wrought men’s praise to rouse,

6   Here, Lord, we give ourselves to Thee;
    Receive us into Thy wise hands;
    Bend, break, and build together in Thee
    To be the house to meet Thy demands.

7   Break all the natural life for us,
    Deal Thou with each peculiar way,
    That we no more independent be
    But with all saints are one for aye.

8   Then we shall be Thy Bride beloved,
    Together in Thy chamber abide,
    Enjoy the fullness of Thy love.

8   Here, O my Lord, may I feast upon Thee;
    Flood with Thy Spirit and fill by Thy Word;
    May, Lord, Thou be such a feast unto me
    As man hath never enjoyed nor e'er heard.

1   I come to Thee, dear Lord,

    My heart doth thirst for Thee;

    Of Thee I’d eat, of Thee I’d drink,

    Enjoy Thee thoroughly.


2   Just to behold Thy face,
    For this my heart doth cry;
    I deeply long to drink of Thee
    My thirst to satisfy.


3   Thy glorious, radiant face
    My heart delights to see;
    Here I’d abide and ne’er depart,
    Beholding constantly.


4   In such a fellowship
    Thou, Lord, art grace to me;
    My heart and spirit gladdened, filled,
    I enter rest in Thee.


5   Lord, I would linger here,
    Still seeking after Thee,
    Continue in the Word and prayer
    Till Thou dost flow thru me.

    Vict’ry is supplied.

2   Now Thy flowing life, Lord,
    Doth enlighten me,
    Bringing in the spirit
    Fellowship with Thee;
    All my need supplying,
    Making Thy demand,
    Leading me to cleansing
    And in Thee to stand.

3   Thy anointing Spirit
    Me shall permeate,
    All my soul and spirit
    Thou wouldst saturate;
    Every part transforming
    Till conformed to Thee,
    Till Thy life shall bring me
    To maturity.

4   Lord, Thy life abundant,
    Flowing, rich and free,
    Constantly refreshes
    And empowers me.
    Death by life is swallowed,
    Weakness is made strong,
    All my bonds are broken,
    Gloom is turned to song.
5   I would give myself, Lord,
    Fully unto Thee,
    That Thy heart’s desire
    Be fulfilled in me.
    I no more would struggle
    To myself reform,
    Thus in me to hinder
    What Thou wouldst perform.



6   I would cease completely
    From my efforts vain,
    Let Thy life transform me,
    Full release to gain;
    Build me up with others
    Till in us Thou see
    Thy complete expression
    Glorifying Thee.

    Her walls before Thee stand,
    Dear as the apple of Thine eye
    And graven on Thy hand.



3   For her my tears shall fall,
    For her my prayers ascend;
    To her my cares and toils be given
    Till toils and cares shall end.



4   Beyond my highest joy
    I prize her heavenly ways,
    Her sweet communion, solemn vows,
    Her hymns of love and praise.



5   Sure as Thy truth shall last,
    To Zion shall be given
    The brightest glories earth can yield,
    And brighter bliss of heaven.

3   Hallelujah! Christ is Victor,
    Therefore do and dare;
    Go wherever Jesus sends you
    In prevailing prayer.


4   Hallelujah! Christ is Victor,
    No defeat nor fear
    Evermore must dim thy vision!
    Christ the way will clear.

1   The name of Jesus is our stand,
            A                       D
         It is our victory;
                                             A7-D
    Not on ourselves do we rely,
                    A           E                A
         But mighty Lord, on Thee.
    A7      D
    Our weapons are not arms of flesh,
                                                     A
         But ours the Spirit’s sword,
           D                                  D7         G
    And God’s whole armor putting on,
                D       G   D   A       D
         We battle in the Lord.

2   Behold, the foe doth meet and plot,
        Stand firm in one accord!
    Though war be fierce and darkness thick,
        Resist him in the Lord!
    If one thru fear should backward turn,
        He undermines the rest.
    Oh, do not let your brothers down,
        Nor by you be distressed.

3   The devil knows his time is short,
       He is the more enraged,
    And by his wiles would weaken us
       Before the battle’s waged.
    The trials now more numerous are,
       The suff’ring e’en more sore,
    The force of hell opposing us
       More dreadful than before.

4   What should our posture be today
        In such a desperate hour?
    Should we our ease and pleasure seek
        And let the foe devour?
    Or with increasing conflict strong,
        Courageous to endure?
    ’Tis here that life or death is won!
        Who will God’s praise secure?
5   For Christ the Lord we then would stand,
        He is the Conqueror!
    For Him we would endure the pain
        Until the fight is o’er.
    The hour of triumph soon we’ll see—
        The Lord will come again;
    If now we suffer for His sake,
        Then we with Him shall reign.

1   Give up the world, Christ to obtain,
                G7                      C
    He is your heart’s very need;
                                   C7           F
    What else can you desire or seek?
                      C    G       C
    All things are empty indeed!

        G         C        F                C
        He is so rich, He is so full,
                      G7                    C
        He can fulfill all your needs!
                           C7               F
        He is so good, He is so sweet,
                  C        G            C
        All your desire He exceeds!

2   Give up the world, Christ to obtain,
    He is the One you require;
    Once you receive this glorious Christ,
    Never the rest you’ll desire.

3   Though very great is all the world,
    And very small is your heart,
    Yet the great world with all its wealth
    Never can fill your small heart.

4   If you have Christ, you have all joys;
    Without this Christ, only pains;
    Where there is Christ there morning is;
    Where He is not, night remains.

        D E              A
        Jesus will save.

2   Though they are slighting Him,
    Still He is waiting,
    Waiting the penitent child to receive;
    Plead with them earnestly,
    Plead with them gently;
    He will forgive if they only believe.

3   Down in the human heart,
    Crushed by the tempter,
    Feelings lie buried that grace can restore;
    Touched by a loving heart,
    Wakened by kindness,
    Chords that are broken will vibrate once more.

4   Rescue the perishing,
    Duty demands it;
    Strength for thy labor the Lord will provide;
    Back to the narrow way,
    Patiently win them;
    Tell the poor wand’rer a Savior has died.

1   Lo, the central thought of God
    A7                D
    Is that He be one with man;
           G          F# F#7 Bm
    He to man is everything
               Em             A7   D
    That He might fulfill His plan.

2   Earthen vessel man was made –
    Body, soul, and spirit too,
    God as life that he may take
    And with Him have oneness true.

3   By the flow of life divine,
    Man becomes a precious stone
    Fit for building God’s abode,
    That His glory might be known.

4   ’Tis the city God hath built,
    ’Tis the dwelling God requires,
    ’Tis the new Jerusalem
    Which fulfills His heart’s desires.

5   ’Tis the building of the saints,
    ’Tis the blend of God and man,
    Purposed by the Father’s will
    Long before the world began.

6   In its center, as its pow’r,
    Is the throne of Christ and God,
    Whence doth flow the stream of life
    As the Spirit’s living flood.

7   Christ, the tree of life, is there
    In the flowing of the stream,
    Yielding fruit of life divine
    As the food of life supreme.

8   God in Christ, the glorious light,
    Through the city brightly shines,
    Scattering all the deathly night
    With its light of life divine.
9   God in man and man in God
    Mutual dwelling thus possess;
    God the content is to man,
    And the man doth God express.

1   There is a fountain filled with blood
                                 E
    Drawn from Immanuel’s veins;
         A                       D          A
    And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,
                   E         A
    Lose all their guilty stains:

    Lose all their guilty stains,

    Lose all their guilty stains.

2   The dying thief rejoiced to see
    That fountain in his day;
    And there may I, though vile as he,
    Wash all my sins away:
    Wash all my sins away,
    Wash all my sins away;
    And there may I, though vile as he,
    Wash all my sins away.

3   Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood
    Shall never lose its power,
    Till all the ransomed ones of God
    Be saved, to sin no more:
    Be saved, to sin no more,
    Be saved, to sin no more;
    Till all the ransomed ones of God,
    Be saved to sin no more.

4   E’er since by faith I saw the stream
    Thy flowing wounds supply,
    Redeeming love has been my theme,
    And shall be till I die:
    And shall be till I die,
    And shall be till I die;
    Redeeming love has been my theme,
    And shall be till I die.
5   When this poor lisping, stammering tongue
    Lies silent in the grave,
    Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
    I’ll sing Thy power to save:
    I’ll sing Thy power to save,
    I’ll sing Thy power to save;
    Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
    I’ll sing Thy power to save.

2   I see the dear Redeemer raised,
    I hear the speaking blood;
    It speaks! My spirit is amazed!

    Above the world and sin,
    With heart renewed and garments white

    There’s a fountain flowing for the soul unclean,
    O be washed in the blood of the Lamb.

    Grace to cover all my sin;
    Let the healing streams abound;
    Make and keep me pure within.
    Thou of life the fountain art,
    Freely let me take of Thee;
    Spring Thou up within my heart,
    Rise to all eternity.

    Our spirits rejoice in this living inflow.
        G                  G7                C               D
    For just as our body the breath does receive,
        G            Em         D                G-C-G
    So also in spirit to live it is so.

2   The Spirit today is the air that we breathe;
    What thing more important than breathing to do?
    For breathing each moment, new life we receive,
    And God’s living freshness is constant and new.

3   For God has been processed, as air now, He’s free;
    This life-giving pneuma is all that we need.
    He’s rich and abundant, so plentiful, He,
    In spirit to walk is to breathe Him indeed.

4   O, say, aren’t you glad that the Spirit’s outpoured
    And God, fully processed, is flowing in us?
    So freely we’re breathing this life-giving Lord,
    And breathing, receiving His life, glorious!

       Our life evermore.

3   In spirit reborn,
    We’re being transformed,
    And to God’s Son completely
    We’ll soon be conformed.

       Hallelujah! Life imparting,
       Hallelujah! Transformed,
       Hallelujah! Soon transfigured
       And to Him conformed!

4   Conformed we will be
    As in spirit we feed
    On the life of the One
    Who knows all that we need.

       Hallelujah! Full salvation!
       Hallelujah! Our prize!
       Hallelujah! So sufficient
       For all of our lives.

1   In the Word of God I found it,
    D    A7    D             A                D
    Wonderful this Word to me;
            F#m                  Em               A7
    I need not man’s natural teaching,

    The anointing lives in me!

2   Making Christ experiential,
    God at His pure Word I take;
    As the Spirit joined unto me,
    He cannot His promise break.


3   Based upon the blood that cleanses
    So that nothing stands between,
    Christ, the ointment, moves within me!
    For His move I’m made so clean.


4   God in Christ as life in Spirit
    Into my own spirit came!
    He the Holy One anoints me
    Till in spirit we’re the same.
5   God in Spirit; I can touch Him;
    In my spirit He’s the flow.
    Deeper, wider, richer, fuller —
    Oh, the very God I know!


6   As I heed “that same anointing”
    Ever to “abide in Him,”
    He is teaching, He is reaching,
    Even all my heart to win.

1   The tree of life, how sweet the fruit,
                           D
    With God as life complete.
        G                  C       G
    I once was dead, but now I live,
            Em         D       G
    Was starved, but now I eat.



2   ’Twas God that brought me to the tree,
    With Christ Himself as meat;
    How precious did that tree become
    When I began to eat.



3   The Lord Himself is food to me,
    He is my life supply;
    He will my pure enjoyment be,
    None else can satisfy.



4   I freely eat this living tree,
    For eating is the way
    To put God’s life inside of me,
    To live by Him today.

1   Sing praise to Christ who lives in us,
    B7   Em         A           D
    The God of our salvation;
                                G    D
    Who saves us by His life divine,
    B7   Em         A       D
    And not by regulation;
    Bm              F#m         Bm           A
    After we’ve worked – done all we can,
         D     A        D                A
    His life has power to change a man:
         G         Em       A        D
    His life divine can change us.

2   He saves us to the uttermost
    By His life-giving power;
    Transfusing Himself into us,
    He saves us hour by hour.
    He saved the lost by coming in,
    He’s saving now from more than sin:
    He’s saving us to glory!

3   Our Lord was constituted priest
    To be a real life-giver;
    Life is the nature of this One
    Who can from self deliver:
    His life is indestructible,
    By it He saves us to the full:
    Praise God, He’s fully able!

4   His life is fully qualified
    To bring us through to glory;
    Were it not for His tested life,
    ’Twould be another story
    His life was fully tried on earth,
    To crucifixion from His birth:
    He passed through death and Hades.
5   He’s pledged to save us to the full,
    His life is operating;
    He’s doing everything for us
    ’Tis all for our perfecting;
    Our life’s a failure at its best,
    Only His life can stand the test:
    His life brings full salvation!


6   He’s living now to intercede,
    Continuing forever;
    He undertakes into the age,
    His priesthood changes never;
    He always lives to intercede,
    Such a High Priest is what we need:
    He’s higher than the heavens.


7   Come forward now to God through Him,
    Ne’er shrink back to destruction;
    Come forward now to get the life,
    Which brings the proper function;
    Come forward now the life to take,
    By life His people us He’ll make,
    And swallow death forever.

    We’re at the fountain drinking;
    Seek but Himself, the heaven of heaven,
    And find Him here at home!



3   Though Satan fights with all his power,
    We’re at the fountain drinking;
    He’ll not prevail, not one short hour,
    Against the church, our home!



4   Athirst we to this spring do fly,
    We’re at the fountain drinking;
    Drink deep, this well will not run dry!
    It’s in the church, our home!

               G          D7       G–C–G
        Take freely the water of life!


2   Christ, our river, Christ, our water, springing from within;
    Christ, our tree, and Christ, the fruits, to be enjoyed therein,
    Christ, our day, and Christ, our light,
    And Christ, our morning star:
    Christ, our everything!


3   We are washing all our robes the tree of life to eat;
    “O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!” — Jesus is so sweet!
    We our spirits exercise, and thus experience Christ.
    What a Christ have we!


4   Now we have a home so bright that outshines the sun,
    Where the brothers all unite and truly are one.
    Jesus gets us all together, Him we now display
    In the local church.

    He’s fairer than the sons of men
            A7            D7

2   His glory broke upon us when we saw Him in the church,
    For here are all His riches,
    Here we’ve given up our search;
    ‘Tis here He satisfies our longing
    Spirits o’er and o’er,
    And every day He’s dearer than He was the day before.


3   Now He’s the living Spirit who within our spirit dwells,
    And by His sweet anointing,
    How His life within us swells!
    As with the saints we’re meeting,
    Full released our spirits soar,
    For now our Lord is dearer than He ever was before.


4   The Lord has made us one with Him for His recovery:
    The riches of this Christ,
    The church His fullness, men must see.
    Yes, all we have and all we are,
    We every day outpour
    For His tremendous purpose, ever dearer than before.

    Who within our spirit dwells;
    How available, how near He is,
    And His sweetness all excels.


3   We have found the way to live by Christ –
    Pray His Word and call His name!
    This – the eating, drinking – has sufficed
    And its worth we now proclaim.


4   We have found the local church, our home;
    We are home and home indeed!
    Nevermore in Babylon we roam;
    In the church is all we need.


5   We have found that meeting with the saints
    Is the greatest joy on earth;
    ’Tis by this our spirit never faints
    And our lives are filled with worth.

        A fount in gardens, a well of living waters,
        Which streams and flows from Lebanon’s mountains.

3   O come Beloved,
    On my garden blow,
    That the odor of spices
    May break forth and flow,
    That the odor of spices
    May break forth and flow.

        My spouse, My sister, I’m come into My garden
        To feast upon wine, milk and honey.

4   Set me, Lord Jesus,
    As seal on Thine heart;
    Jealousy’s cruel as Sheol,
    And love’s strong as death,
    Jealousy’s cruel as Sheol,
    And love’s strong as death.

        Much water cannot quench love, nor do floods drown it.
        All man could give for love is contemned.

    Loving Thee, I’m deeply satisfied.
    Love outpoured from hidden depths within me,
    Costly oil, dear Lord, I would provide.

4   My Beloved, come on spices’ mountain;
    How I yearn to see Thee face to face.
    Drink, dear Lord, from my heart’s flowing fountain,
    Till I rest fore’er in Thine embrace.
    Not alone, O Lord, do I adore Thee,
    But with all the saints as Thy dear Bride;
    Quickly come, our love is waiting for Thee;

    At Thy feet cast all my hard’nings,
    And return with songs and singings;
    ’Tis my love to be Thy bondslave,
    ’Tis my joy to Thee obey.


4   Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,
    Thy way only will I choose;
    Though in tears while I’m obeying,
    Yet I would not change my standing;
    All I long for is Thy pleasure,
    And the peace Thy love would bring.
5   Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,
    When Thy presence does depart,
    Seems the dawn has lost its traces,
    Hidden are my smiling faces;
    All I yearn for is Thy coming
    And Thy presence’ sweet embrace.

6   Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,
    Can I tell it all to Thee?
    Thou my love and satisfaction,
    Thou my everlasting portion;
    Thou art all that I desire,
    Nothing else I would pursue.

7   Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,
    All I have I give to Thee;
    Who like Thee – so fair and comely?
    Who like Thee – so sweet and lovely?
    Matchless One, unrivaled beauty,
    None can e’er compete with Thee!

1   Jesus, the all-inclusive land,
                    D         G
    Is everything to me:
        D                                  G                   Em
    A Christ of brooks, of depths and streams,
                D            A7                D-D7
    And fountains bubbling free.
    G                        Am            G           C   G
    Springing from valleys and from hills,
                        Am        G        C       G
    Flowing till every part He fills,
    G                   Em    G                    D
    He waters us — how glorious —
    G       D       G-C-G
    By His life!

2   Jesus is now the land of wheat —
    Incarnate, crucified.
    But resurrection life is He
    By barley signified.
    He is a land of figs and vines —
    Blood of the grape, the cheering wine.
    With such supplies He satisfies —
    Christ our land!

3   O what a rich, abundant Christ:
    Our pomegranate true,
    The olive tree whose oil is now
    Anointing us anew.
    Rich milk and honey He doth bring,
    Sweet, satisfying, nourishing.
    Our Christ is such; He is so much!
    What a Christ!

4   In our good land we eat the bread —
    There is no scarcity.
    We never lack one thing in Him,
    So rich, so full is He.
    He is a land so vast, immense;
    He is complete in every sense.
    How He expands — land of all lands—
    In our heart!
5   Christ is a land of iron stones,
    Whence comes authority.
    We must dig out this solid Christ
    To bind His enemy.
    Then we must through the sufferings pass
    To be refined as burnished brass.
    With iron bind, as brass refined,
    Is our need.

6   Lord, how we bless Thee for this land,
    The all-inclusive Christ!
    We've eaten Him, we're filled with Him,
    O how He has sufficed!
    Teach us to labor constantly
    Upon this vast reality;
    This is our joy, this our employ —
    Christ our land!

1   The Lord is my Shepherd forever,

    He maketh me down to lie,

                    Bm            E                  A-A7
        And I shall feast at the table spread for me;

        Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
               A             A7           D
        All the days, all the days of my life.

2   My Shepherd Himself is my pasture,
    My Shepherd, the waters of rest;
    I eat of His riches in spirit,
    I drink, and O how I am blest!

3   My Shepherd my soul is restoring,
    My will, and emotion, and mind;
    And though through the valley I’m walking,
    O what a Companion I find!

4   A table prepared by my Shepherd
    I feast on and Satan destroy;
    My head is anointed with oil,
    My cup runneth over with joy!

5   And now in His house I am dwelling
    Enjoying the goodness of God;
    My pleasure is far beyond telling,
    My pleasure is Jesus my Lord!

1   We’ve found the secret of living,
                             A
    We’ve seen the vision divine:
    D
    We are of God in Christ Jesus,
    G           D    A                   D
    We’re abiding, abiding in the vine.



            G                    D
        Abiding in the vine, abiding in the vine,
        E                                    A - A7
        All the riches of God’s life are mine!

            D       A7               D
        Abiding, abiding in the vine.



2   No more in vain need we struggle,
    Trying the way in to find.
    Praise God – we’re in Him already,
    Hallelujah, abiding in the vine.



3   In us, the ointment is moving,
    ’Tis the anointing divine;
    God’s precious essence bestowing,
    While abiding, abiding in the vine.



4   Now in the life-flow we’re living,
    O how the light in us shines!
    Both God and man are at home now
    By the mutual abiding in the vine.

    But it’s not sufficient just to see:
    G        G7                 C
    He in our experience must be
    Bm       Bb             Am7 D
    Everything to us.
    G          Em                            Am           D
    We in prayer behold Him face to face,

    In the Word and meetings know His grace;

    But in daily life, in every place,
    Bb            D7        G
    What is He to us?

         Every thing, in every way and –

         Be specific for reality!

         If we’ll just apply Him, we will see
                            D           G
         He’s everything to us.

2   Life is full of opportunities
    Ordered by our Father’s hand: we see
    Everything’s the best that it could be,
    So let’s gain Christ!
    Christ our content and reality
    To shine out from us unceasingly:
    He must have a way in you and me,
    He must have a way.
Hallelujah! In the body we
Bear the death of Christ continually:
Thus His life comes forth for all to see as
The outer man is broken down,
The inner man is shining so that –
In these earthen vessels men can see
There’s the treasure of reality!
Thus the gospel’s glorious light will be
Shining out from us.

Not just doctrines and theology,
But the content of reality:
Christ as everything in you and me,
He’s everything to us!

          A
1   My old man has been crucified with Him,
              E7                          A
    With all its foul corruption deep within;
                   D                  A
    And buried too its nature serpentine,
                   E       A    A7   D
    Completely finished – this great fact is mine,
      A        E7 A D A
    I hold it fast.



2   But there’s a Person in my spirit now,
    Born as a babe so small, so weak, so low;
    Who by the Word’s pure milk will grow to be
    The overcoming inner man in me
    To gain my heart.



3   Christ as my Person must possess my heart
    And be preeminent in every part.
    The former owner died but haunts it still.
    O Lord, move in; my mind, emotion, will
    Now welcome Thee.




4   In spirit mingled, we are one, O Lord,
    The human and divine in one accord;
    Yet Thou must have a proper faculty
    That all Thy glorious personality
    May be expressed.



5   So, Lord, I give my heart to Thee today,
    That it may be Thy home in every way,
    A place for Thee to come and settle down,
    And all Thy grand recovery work to crown
    In one new man.

    The Triune God flowing in me;

         At Your coming may life be my crown.


2   In the fresh, tender grass Jesus makes me lie down;
    He leads me by waters of rest;
    No more struggle and strain;
    All self-effort is vain;
    In the flow I am perfectly blessed.


3   Jesus called me one day to the Holiest Place,
    To live in His presence divine;
    Hallelujah, I’ve heard
    An encouraging word:
    "Abide — you’re a branch in the vine."

    As the Spirit flowing into us.

    He’s our life so rich and bountiful.

2   We experienced regeneration
    When we opened to this living One.
    We were born again; another life came in.
    Now it floods us till we’re full of Him.

3   He within us is the living Spirit
    In our spirit, flowing out of it
    Into all our heart, transforming every part
    By the life which He Himself imparts.

4   Now He must have our cooperation.
    We must set our mind upon the Son.
    We must turn away from all that leads astray,
    Till our mind is set on Him each day.

5   Lord, our human spirit now contains You.
    Still Your purpose in us You would do;
    If our wandering mind would leave old thoughts behind,
    Then Your life and peace in it we’ll find.

6   Lord, we would our every thought be captured
    By the rich enjoyment in Your Word.
    In it we’re supplied, our mind there will abide,
    Till our thoughts are wholly sanctified.

7   Let’s keep practicing the application
    Of this life by minding just the Son.
    Praise Him for the way to live by Him today!
    Lord, on You our minds will ever stay.

1   A mighty flowing-out is God,
    Am Em      F             C    Am Dm-G-C
    He flows throughout the ages.
                   G        Em Am D7 G
    And so to flow Himself to man,
    Am Em F C Am Dm-G-C
    He is in many stages;

    Yet still one God is He,

    And now He flows within us!


2   In the beginning we can see,
    God as a flowing river,
    The river to convey the tree,
    Himself as life deliver.
    And at the end the same,
    The river doth remain,
    God in the Lamb doth flow,
    The tree prevails to grow,
    And God flows on forever.


3   God flowed Himself into a man,
    The man we call Christ Jesus.
    He gave up His own life for man
    And God’s own life releases.
    Though Satan did his best
    To put God’s flow to rest —
    He had Him crucified
    And cruelly pierced His side —
    But out came blood and water!
4   The blood and water flowed from Him,
    In streams of pure salvation.
    The blood brings cleansing from all sin;
    Water, regeneration.
    And now the Spirit flows,
    Brings God where’er He goes.
    All he could do, the foe,
    Was just release the flow.
    And God just keeps on flowing.

    Look   away    from all the strife and din;
    Look   away    where peace is found — Hallelujah,
    Look   away    from everything to Him.


3   Look   away    from fickle soul — Hallelujah,
    Look   away    from failing self within;
    Look   away    toward the goal — Hallelujah,
    Look   away    from everything to Him.


4   Look away from all the past — Hallelujah,
    Look away from both the good and sin;
    To the living One hold fast — Hallelujah,
    Look away from everything to Him.


5   Look away into His face — Hallelujah,
    He who’ll finish what He did begin.
    O what grace to run the race — Hallelujah —
    We obtain by looking off to Him!

    G                        C
1   We have an inner life; that’s for our daily life;
    G                                   D
    That’s for the meeting life – just Christ!
    G                        C
    We’ll live the inner life; we’ll have the daily life;
    G                                    D         G
    We’ll see the meeting life – that’s just the church.

2   Christ is our inner life; He’s in our spirit now;
    Not far away from us – He’s right inside!
    And as we turn to Him and take Him as our all,
    He will become in us our inner life.

3   Out from our inner life will come our daily life,
    And all our living be filled up with Christ.
    Then as we live by Him, He lives His life in us,
    And He becomes to us our daily life.


4   The real experience of Christ in daily life,
    Will fill the meeting life with Christ Himself.
    Not empty forms and such, but Christ will be so much;
    And we will see Him here as the meeting life.


5   Without the inner life there is no daily life,
    There is no meeting life, there is no church!
    Christ as our inner life, Christ in our daily life
    Will make the meeting life new and glorious!

1   Jesus, our wonderful Shepherd
    E7                             A-A7
    Brought us right out of the fold
    D                    A       F#m
    Into His pasture so plenteous,
    B7                 E7
    Into His riches untold.

         Glorious church life,
                                       E
         Feasting from such a rich store!
         A7                  D             A   F#m
         Here where we’re dwelling in oneness
         E7                        A
         God commands life evermore.


2   In the divisions He sought us,
    Weary and famished for food;
    Into the good land He brought us,
    Oh, to our spirit how good!


3   Jesus Himself is our pasture,
    He is the food that we eat;
    We as His sheep are fed richly
    Each time, whenever we meet.


4   Dwell we here on a high mountain,
    Wet with the morning-fresh dew,
    Slaking our thirst at the fountain,
    Water so living and new.


5   Christ is our rest and enjoyment,
    Here we have nothing to fear;
    Here all the sheep dwell securely,
    Kept by His presence so dear.

    G        G7              C                  G
1   Once by nature we were dead in sin,
                                 D7
    In a world of utter discord;
    G       G7       C                          G
    But together God has quickened us,
                                 D7                 G-C-G
    Raised us up to sit together with the Lord.

                     C                Cm
        Jesus is getting us together,
        G                        D7
        Come and see the saints in one accord.
        G                C                 Cm
        His love is knitting us together,
                 G                    D7              G-C-G
        To the stature of the fullness of the Lord.

2   Thus with all saints we can apprehend,
    All the vast dimensions of God.
    Knowing Christ’s love passes all we know,
    We’re together filled to fullness with our God.

3   Now we know the purpose of our God,
    Visible the mystery became:
    Christ, the church, together now we see,
    And together put the enemy to shame.

4   For this cause we pray the Father God —
    Strengthen Thou with might our inner man;
    Make Yourself at home in all our hearts,
    Root us, ground us in Your love and for Your plan.

5   In the Body we’ll be fitly framed
    As the many members Christ supply;
    Working in the measure of each part,
    All by growth in love the Body edify.

6   Now we’re one His purpose to fulfill,
    As the one new man of His plan.
    Unto Him be glory in the church,
    And in Jesus Christ forevermore — Amen!

    G
1   Oh, the church of Christ is glorious,
         C                G
    And we are part of it —
                               A7                   D
    We’re so happy that the Lord has made us one!
                 G
    There’s a Body in the universe
         C                G
    And we belong to it —
                          D                 G-C-G
    Hallelujah, for the Lord has made us one!

        Hallelujah for the Body!
                     D7
        We are members of the Body!
                     G             C
        We are wholly for the Body!
             G                D7                  G-C-G
        Hallelujah, for the Lord has made us one!

2   Not the individual Christians,
    But a corporate entity —
    God must have it for His full expression now;
    Not just individual churches
    But the Body corporately —
    Hallelujah, we are in the Body now!

        Hallelujah for the Body!
        Satan trembles at the Body!
        We’re victorious in the Body!
        Hallelujah, we are in the Body now!

3   There are seven golden lampstands
    In the nature all divine —
    Nothing natural does the Body life allow.
    When we’re one and share God’s nature,
    How the lampstand then does shine —
    Hallelujah, it is brightly shining now!

        Hallelujah for the Body!
        For the lampstands of the Body!
        For the golden, shining Body!
        Hallelujah, it is brightly shining now!
4   How may we express such oneness,
    Be divine and shining too?
    Hallelujah, eating Jesus is the way!
    He’s the tree of life, the manna,
    And the feast that’s ever new —
    Hallelujah, we may eat Him every day!

       We are one by eating Jesus!
       We’re divine by eating Jesus!
       How we shine by eating Jesus!
       Hallelujah, eating Jesus is the way!

    G
1   Splendid church life! His green garden!
               C
    He has brought us, praise the Lord,
          D7                                    G-C-G
    To experience the Christ Who’s growing here!

    He is full of rich enjoyment
               C
    To His saints in one accord;
             D7                         G-C-G
    He is new and fresh, available and dear.

                   G7   C
        I’m so happy in this lovely place,
        D7                            G-C-G
        In the garden growing in His grace!

        There is no finer pleasure
                    C
        Than to eat the living tree
                   D7                    G-C-G
        And to get the living water into me.

2   It is not a school or fact’ry
    Or a chapel in the air;
    But a garden where our Lord can plant and sow.
    So He’s placed us all here corporately
    To be His garden fair,
    Where He’s free to cultivate and make us grow.

3   Thus within the church-life garden
    There’s a fruit-producing tree
    Full of life and so available to eat.
    So be simple, don’t be hardened,
    Drop your concepts — eat that tree!
    Take in Jesus every moment — He’s so sweet!

4   With the tree there is the water,
    Flowing God in Christ to us,
    Quenching all our dryness, ending all our strife.
    Hallelujah! In His garden
    Jesus flows Himself to us,
    As the full supply for us to grow in life.
5   Aren’t you satisfied and thankful
    That our Lord has brought you in
    Where His pleasures and His riches flow so free?
    So be happy and be joyful,
    In the spirit feast on Him,
    So God’s garden can bear fruit abundantly.

1   What a happy day
                            C
    When I no more could turn away,
                           G                    Em
    When Jesus took my heart from the black of night
        Am   D                  G-C-G
    Into the kingdom of His light.


2   Now my life’s begun,
    The “really life” that’s in the Son.
    No more am I enthralled by earth’s empty dreams;
    Deep in me flows a living stream.


3   As I turn to Him
    He fills me with His life within.
    His life becomes my life in reality;
    Oh, hallelujah, He’s in me!


4   I just love You, Lord,
    With other loves, You break the cord.
    You’ll be my life for all eternity;
    You are the only One for me.

1   Never did I dream before,
    G                                  D
    Such a place could e’er be found,
                                       F#m
    Where the tears of sorrow cease,
    G                      D
    Songs of endless joy abound.
              G            D
    One who seldom ever sang,
    Em                             A
    Now delights his voice to raise;
             G                         D
    Singing hymns with all the saints,
    Em   A                     D
    Echoing the ceaseless praise.

2   Day by day the world goes on,
    Just as it has gone before.
    Millions grasp and clutch at life,
    Wond’ring if there could be more;
    Such was I and would be, yet
    Mercy found me out somehow;
    With what gratefulness I say,
    “I’m in God’s own family now.”

3   How delightful ’tis to know;
    How subjective, real, and sweet
    Is this inward joy of grace
    We experience when we meet;
    Life abundant Jesus gives
    As my full reality;
    Praise You, Lord, it’s really true,
    I’m in Your own family.

4   At the closing of this age,
    Just before Your kingdom’s dawn,
    May You gain a people, Lord,
    For Your dwelling place, Your home.
    Since for me You gave Your all,
    Everything I lay aside;
    For Your church my all I’d give,
    That You would be satisfied.

    D                        F#m
1   Recall how David swore,
           G                  A
    “I’ll not come into my house,
            D                F#m
    Nor go up to my bed,
            G                      A
    Give slumber to mine eyelids,
        G              D
    Until I find a place for Thee,
    Em A            F#m           Bm
    A place, O Lord, for Thee.”
            Em       D        G            D
    Our mighty God desires a home
                G        A             D
    Where all His own may come.

2   How blinded we have been,
    Shut in with what concerns us;
    While God’s house lieth waste —
    Lord, break through, overturn us;
    We’ll go up to the mountain,
    Bring wood and build the house;
    We’ll never say, “Another day!”
    It’s time! We’ll come and build!

3   O Lord, against these days,
    Inspire some for Your building,
    Just as in David’s day —
    A remnant who are willing
    To come and work in Your house,
    Oh, what a blessed charge!
    Your heart’s desire, is our desire —
    We come, O Lord, to build.

4   Within those whom You’d call
    Put such a restless caring
    For building to give all —
    These times are for preparing;
    The gates of hell cannot prevail
    Against the builded Church!
    The hours are few, the builders too —
    Lord, build, O build in us!

2   We were bound in Egypt, building for the foe;
    God of the Hebrews said, “Let My people go!”
    We have crossed the Red Sea, reached the other side;
    Pharaoh, his army, perished in the tide.

         God of the Hebrews,    speak again today;
         God of the Hebrews,    lead us all the way.
         Save all Your people   from this crooked age,
         Save all Your people   from this crooked age.



3   We’re released, and now we build the house of God;
    His tabernacle is our true abode.
    Forty years of oldness left in Jordan’s tide,
    Fight we for Canaan on the kingdom side.

         Salvation’s Captain sounds the trump of war;
         City by city, take we more and more,
         To gain His kingdom, enter into rest,
         To gain His kingdom, enter into rest.
4   What was once God-given soon a form became;
    Then John the Baptist did God’s word proclaim —
    Make another crossing, God is going on;
    Judaism’s over; listen to My Son!

       Turn from the prophets, turn unto the Son;
       He’s My Beloved, He and I are one;
       His Word will save you to the uttermost,
       His Word will save you to the uttermost.



5   Now we’re overcomers on the sea of glass;
    This final crossing will forever last.
    Sing the song of Moses, make the praise complete,
    Look! All our enemies beneath our feet.

       We’re overcomers, that’s our real name.
       God has His city; Satan gets the shame.
       God is our portion for eternity,
       God is our portion for eternity.

2   We have the blood! Christ is our spotless offering,
    Who gave Himself, our God to satisfy;
    And so we come with boldness to the throne of grace,
    And all day long, the precious blood apply.



3   We have the Word! The written Word’s our daily food;
    We mix this Word with faith and say “Amen!”
    Then thro’ the day, the spoken Word will speak to us
    And regulate our living from within.
4   The Spirit’s ours! The Spirit of reality,
    He’s independent of the way we feel;
    He dwells in us, and teaches us to dwell in Him,
    And guides us into everything that’s real.



5   We have the church! All saints are needed to possess
    The fulness of this vast reality;
    Together we will gain this all-inclusive Christ,
    And He to us our everything will be.

2   His Son, Jesus, is our Savior.
    Once in human form He came.
    Now as Spirit He can enter
    As the breath of life to man.
    As a seed within our spirit
    Christ takes root and starts to grow,
    Spreading in our inmost being
    Till His life we come to know.
3   Time is short, oh, brothers, hear it,
    Christ is longing for His Bride.
    We can hasten His returning
    Simply by the growth in life.
    No more struggling, no more striving,
    Simply turn to Christ within.
    See the seed begin to blossom,
    Growing fully into Him.


       Jesus Christ will get His kingdom
       By growing in a normal way.
       It’s not an instant transformation.
       This growth goes on from day to day.
       The seed of life is all-inclusive.
       It’s got everything we’ll ever need.
       Yes, our God’s eternal purpose
       Is all within this precious seed.

    We have oil in our lamps today!
             D                        G
    To the spirit, O Lord, keep us turning,

    Keep us turning, turning all the way!

2   But our vessels need oil for Thy coming;
    We must gain a reserve supply.
    So our vessels we give for the filling
    That our lamps may never, never die.


        Fill us, Jesus! Fill us, Jesus!
        Every moment give us more of Thee!
        Fill us, Jesus! Fill us, Jesus!
        Fill us with reality!


3   Then we’ll burn till the Lord comes to meet us,
    Then we’ll burn till He comes that day.
    Then we’ll go in with Him to the wedding
    And be brightly burning all the way.


        Come, Lord Jesus! Come, Lord Jesus!

1   God eternal has a purpose,
    G          D        Em       D
    Formed in His eternal past,
    G          D       Em        D
    Spreading to eternal future;
    G              D             Em           D
    ‘Twixt these ends all time is cast.
    C                                     G
    For with time there is the process,
    C                                 G
    Time for His accomplishment;
    C                                 G
    And in time we’re merely travelers —
    C                       G
    For eternity we’re meant.

2   God would have a group of people
    Built together in His plan,
    Blended, knit, coordinated
    As His vessel — one new man.
    God would come into this vessel
    With His nature, life and ways,
    Mingling Spirit with our spirits
    For His joy and to His praise.

3   God has worked in three directions
    For His plan so marvelous:
    As the Father, Son, and Spirit
    To dispense Himself to us!
    All creation gives the setting —
    Heav’n and earth are for this plan;
    ‘Tis for this God made a body,
    Soul and spirit — three-part man.

4   As the center, as the kernel,
    Of God’s plan our spirit is;
    Calling on the name of Jesus
    Makes our spirit one with His.
    From the center to circumference
    God would saturate each part;
    Feeling, mind, and will renewing,
    Making home in all our heart.
5   Thus in life we’re built together,
    Then in love we’re knit as one;
    God is now His plan fulfilling,
    Finishing what He’s begun.
    Lord, increase Thyself within us
    That we might be built by Thee
    Into that great corporate vessel
    Filled with God exclusively.

6   As the product, the fulfillment,
    Will the church in glory stand,
    Consummation of the purpose
    In eternal ages planned.
    God will have His corporate vessel,
    All His glory to contain;
    Lord, we’re wholly for Thy purpose
    All Thy goal in us attain.

    Dm        A7         Dm       A7             Dm
1   Once I thirsted for a fountain,
                    Gm                          Dm-Gm–A7
    Something deep that would satisfy.
    Dm         A7         Dm               A7          Dm
    But the fountain that I’d drink from
              Gm                   Dm A7 Dm-C
    Left me searching and still so dry.


                              F
         Then one day I found Him,
         C                    F
         He satisfied my thirst,
         C                     F       C        Dm
         Became in me a deeper source
         Gm         A7                     Dm
         Whence living waters burst.

         Now I drink Him!

         Jesus, Jesus is my life now,

         A7                            Dm-A7-Dm
         Jesus, Jesus is my life.


2   After tasting such a fountain,
    Longed my heart for a place of springs;
    Caught a vision on a mountain,
    In Jerusalem’s a gathering.


         Then one day He found me;
         He brought me to the church;
         Pleasures here abound fore’er;
         I’ve given up my search.
         Hallelujah!
         Jesus, Jesus is my life now,
         Jesus, Jesus is my life;
         I’m fully satisfied now,
         Jesus, Jesus is my life.
3   Empty wanderer drop the striving —
    Isn’t worth all the troublin’;
    Open up your heart believing;
    Call, “Lord Jesus,” and He’ll come in!


        Then today you’ll find Him,
        And calling on His name,
        You’re joined to Him, you’re one with Him —
        You’ll never be the same.
        You won’t want to!
        Jesus, Jesus is my life now,
        Jesus, Jesus is my life;
        I’m fully satisfied now,
        Jesus, Jesus is my life.

    Is Thy servant warned,

    For He grew up like a tender plant — before Him,

    And like a root out of dry ground.

    He has no attracting form nor majesty
    F                    G            Am
    That we should look upon Him,

    Nor beautiful appearance…
    Nor beautiful appearance that we should desire Him.
    He was despised and forsaken of men,
    A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief;
    And like one from whom men hide their faces,
    He was despised; and we did not esteem Him.

        D           A                     G                A

        D           G        A A7 D
        And He will be satisfied!

2   Surely He has borne our sicknesses,
    And carried our sorrows;
    Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken,
    Smitten of God and afflicted.
    But He was wounded because of our transgressions;
    He was crushed because of our iniquities;

    The chastening for our peace was upon Him,
    And by His stripes we have been healed.
    We all like sheep have gone astray;
    Each of us has turned to his own way,
    And Jehovah has caused the iniquity of us all
    To fall on Him.

And bear much fruit and that your fruit should remain
That whatever you ask— the Father may give you.

  This then is the message which we have heard of Him
  And declare unto you, and declare unto you,


      That God is light and in Him is no darkness at all.
      If we say that we have fellowship with Him
      And walk in darkness,
      We lie and do not the truth,
      Do not the truth;



  But if we walk in the light as He is in the light,
  But if we walk in the light as He is in the light,


      We have fellowship one with another,
      And the blood of Jesus Christ His Son
      Cleanses us from all sin,
      And the blood of Jesus Christ His Son

    Bright as crystal,

    And of the Lamb.
          D                            Bm
    And Thou shalt make them to drink
               Em        A         D
    Of the river of Thy pleasures.


2   There is a river,
    The streams whereof make glad
    The city of God.
    She shall not be moved.
    God shall help her.
    God's in her midst.
    They shall be abundantly satisfied
    With the fatness of Thy house.
